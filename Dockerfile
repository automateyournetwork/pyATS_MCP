# Define the entrypoint to run your server script
# This will execute `python pyats_mcp_server.py` when the container starts
# It will run in continuous stdio mode by default because we removed the --oneshot logic as default
ENTRYPOINT ["python", "pyats_mcp_server.py"]

# CMD can provide default arguments to the ENTRYPOINT if needed.
# For example, if you wanted the default to be --oneshot (not recommended for the server):
# CMD ["--oneshot"]
# For the default continuous mode, no CMD arguments are needed:
CMD []
